# Toolbar Dial

Toolbar Dial is an extension for modern browsers that replaces the new tab page with a colorful grid of your bookmarks and folders.

## Features

### Browser Bookmarks

Bookmarks and folders that you already have in the browser are used for display in the Toolbar Dial grid.

### Ready to Use

No configuration is required, but many customizations are available.

### Custom Backgrounds

A curated collection of backgrounds is available. You can also select a favorite photo from your device.

### Find a Perfect Background

Toolbar Dial offers a curated collection of complementary background colors and images. Have a favorite photo of your family -- or vehicle? (We're not judging!) Browse your device and select a favorite photo to use as the background image. If you'd rather utilize a solid color background that doesn't distract you from the many choices of websites you have to visit, that's an option as well! Customize the color with the color picker, or enter the HEX code of your favorite color.

### Dark Mode

Light and dark color schemes are available. Your device preference is used by default, but you can change it, if desired.
